The project follows a structured layout with directories for pages, components, layouts, and styles. Next.js was chosen for its SSR, SSG, and routing capabilities, while components were designed for reusability and modularity to streamline development. API integration enables dynamic content fetching from sources like the JSONPlaceholder API, and responsive design ensures the application adapts to various screen sizes. Dynamic routing is utilized to display individual blog posts, enhancing user experience and SEO. These choices aim to create a scalable, maintainable, and performant web application with a seamless user experience.
